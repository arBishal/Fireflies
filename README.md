# Fireflies

This simulation was inspired by personal fascination and nostalgia for fireflies. As these luminous insects are sadly declining due to habitat loss, pollution, and light interference, this project serves as a small tribute—preserving their magic in code.

This is a responsive, interactive firefly animation built with Vue 3 and the Canvas API. Fireflies drift across the screen, pulse with light, and react to user interaction.
